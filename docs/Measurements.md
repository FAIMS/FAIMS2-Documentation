Measurements 
------------

[To measure distances between points use the
"Measure" ]![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WtUB9y6QlscOjWH3uiDWmr5JNALrVwpZO_F94Z2SnTPSH-Ye_EYzkH0wzS4NHVR3qDg2aCxTXczOXWHrhqYBj5d8lOK5VRm1DNchGF4dADc6mphB43fsD6YI)][tool
in the top tool bar. Hold it down to see the selection of measurement
tools. The app currently calculates the distance between two points, the
azimuth between two points, the length of a line and the area of
polygon.]

 

[Point Distance]

 

-   Select "Point
    Distance" ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xYKcbhIePpGnVjePD0I97czcRWW3a19lqGPMVx9nZiDRxQk4Auc4w-wtBRdYo6BerfPwJgPMyFsuSL8uiS7HaS4EYMhxVT9xGbNYPMjfdBQ2vbio_LZOQJaz)    from
    the Measure tool dropdown

    are no longer there, reload their layer or make it visible)

-   Each point will become highlighted as you tap on it

-   Observe the blue line that will appear between them with distance
    reading (in m) on it

-   Click "Clear" to clear the calculation

 [Azimuth between point A and B.]

 

-   Select "Azimuth"

    the Measure tool dropdown

-   Tap on two points in your mapview (if they are no longer there,
    reload their layer or make it visible)

-   Each point will become highlighted as you tap on it.

-   Observe the blue line with angle symbol that appears between the
    points and the measurement of  the azimuth (bearing in degrees from
    the North)  

-   Click "Clear" to clear the calculation

 [Line distance]

 

-   Select "Line Distance"
    tool ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/u0gR1R22u2qubZYXnqqfQF0BCQRYo0BUiehYSF_H6Co2ofN-mqRjh4l2S9SRFz52jZdCOZGXBM5cpYnY45D0T1Zm7fALw0KMeFj3irzB30C9jTUst_U7oyParw)    from
    the Measure tool dropdown

-   Tap on the line in your mapview that you want to measure. You can
    only select one line at a time

-   The line will become highlighted and a calculation of its length
    will appear next to it

-   Click "Clear" to clear the calculation 

[Area of the polygon]

 

-   Select "Area"
    tool ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ELBqD7NrSsaq9fH4SH2RHyZqntyVRq8J-K7ozVBpfNpBXv8JMYSuPqhSh0vl4PsgpVAJzXz5cgXbA79BMKgBqDg496plb62jehvz1SYOnraIoBz6t3Wmk0MP)    from
    the Measure tool dropdown

<!-- -->

-   Select a polygon that you want to measure.

-   The selected polygon will become highlighted and a calculation of
