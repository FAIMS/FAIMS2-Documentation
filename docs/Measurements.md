tools. The app currently calculates the distance between two points, the
azimuth between two points, the length of a line and the area of
polygon.]{style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"}

    the Measure tool dropdown

-   Tap the two points that you want to measure in your mapview (if they
    are no longer there, reload their layer or make it visible)

-   Each point will become highlighted as you tap on it

-   Observe the blue line that will appear between them with distance
    reading (in m) on it

-   Click "Clear" to clear the calculation

-   Tap on two points in your mapview (if they are no longer there,
    reload their layer or make it visible)

-   Each point will become highlighted as you tap on it.

-   Observe the blue line with angle symbol that appears between the
    points and the measurement of  the azimuth (bearing in degrees from
    the North)  

-   Click "Clear" to clear the calculation

    only select one line at a time

-   The line will become highlighted and a calculation of its length
