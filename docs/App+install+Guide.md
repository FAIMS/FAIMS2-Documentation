5.  Upon installing the app you will be prompted to download sample
    modules from our server at
    [demo.fedarch.org](http://demo.fedarch.org){.external-link}. Feel
    free to download all of them and browse through, they are for
    demonstration! Please note that different modules will take
    different time to download depending on whether they contain any
    image data or not. 
6.  If you have made arrangements about your own customized module,
    please contact [our
    team](mailto:enquiries@fedarch.org){.external-link} for instructions
    to its whereabouts. You can have as many modules on your device as
    you wish!\

    directly. (We strongly disrecommend this method unless you're aware
    of the risks of installing .apks directly from the internet.
    Therefore we are intentionally leaving out instructions on how to
    install unsigned APKs. Don't do this if you don't know the risks.)
