    free to download all of them and browse through, they are for
    demonstration! Please note that different modules will take
    different time to download depending on whether they contain any
    image data or not.

    please contact [our  team](mailto:enquiries@fedarch.org) for instructions

### Note: Alternative download location

If the download from Google Play
fails, download the app by going to fedarch.org/apk/
or [click here to download](https://www.fedarch.org/apk/faims-android-latest.apk)
directly. (We strongly disrecommend this method unless you're aware
of the risks of installing .apks directly from the internet.
Therefore we are intentionally leaving out instructions on how to
install unsigned APKs. Don't do this if you don't know the risks.)
