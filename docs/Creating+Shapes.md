Creating Shapes
============================================================


Before creating a shape you need to activate/select the layer you want
to create the feature in. By default "Data Entry" layer may be prepared
in some modules. Elsewhere, you may need to click "Add" button and
"Create New Canvas" in the Layer Manager.  Tap the destination layer to
select it (it will be highlighted in blue in the Layer Manager). Its
name will also appear next to the Current Layer
icon. ![](img/0_bottom_layers_s.png)

-   Ensure that you have selected an appropriate destination layer for
    editing

-   Click on "Create" tool in the tool menu. Hold to roll out a menu

    Select whichever you need. Your last selection will be saved in the

Vector Shape Style 
------------------

-   Ensure that you have selected an appropriate destination layer for
    editing

-   Click on "Create" tool in the tool menu. Notice that a "Style" icon
    has appeared in the left top corner of the map.

-   Click the "Style" button and the "Style Settings" dialog will open

-   You can now select the style that you wish your features to display.
    Polygons have the most selectable characteristics while points have
    the least.

-   Min Zoom refers to the minimal zoom below which the features will
    not display. It is currently relative and you need experimentally
    establish what works at your particular scale.  

-   Colors can currently be entered via a color wheel (tap on the
    "color" to bring it up) or by directly typing in an eight digit
    code. The first two digits signify opacity and the next six digits
    or letters are hexadecimal color codes. You can find the complete
    chart of hexadecimal codes
    on [http://html-color-codes.com/](http://html-color-codes.com/).
    If you want it 50% transparent, substitute the initial ff with 80.

-   Point size is the diameter of the point. The current value of 0 -1
    is actually constrained by the resolution of your device's screen.
    Try resetting the value to see what range of point sizes you have
    available. 

-   Picking size refers to the distance from the shape within which you
    need to touch if you want a feature selected.
