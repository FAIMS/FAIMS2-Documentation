Getting started with FAIMS - an overview
=====================================================================================






Background
==========

The arrival of low-cost smartphones and tablets is a game-changing
event for mobile data collection, due to a
convergence of
features:

1.  Touch screen/graphics

2.  Wireless connectivity

3.  GPS

4.  Rear facing camera

5.  Programmability

6.  Ubiquity

As a result of this convergence we can, for the first time, place
location-recording electronic data collectors in the hands of every team
member at very modest cost. Lots of people have been experimenting with
tablets, smart pens etc. but these projects, while often successful in
themselves, will not generally be adopted beyond a limited public of
connected projects eg. working in the same area or working out of the
same institution. That is because they are adapted to specific
circumstances / modes of operation; the investment in making systems
generic is too high for an individual project - it is not cost
effective.

Which is where FAIMS comes in. Through a $1M NeCTAR infrastructure
grant plus $1M co-investment (2013) and a $400K ARC LIEF grant (2014),
FAIMS has focussed on building generic customisable capabilities at a
scale not available to individual projects. FAIMS started with a four
day requirements-gathering international workshop (August 2012), which
assembled 50 people for the full workshop (80 on the first day), 40+
partners, a very wide cross-section of the archaeological community in
Australia plus international participation (ADS, tDAR, Open Context).
FAIMS also has an extremely active core team with a dedicated technical
lead. The team listened to what people had to say and took things on
board, for instance the original plan was to do live mesh
synchronisation of tablets and to support measurements using multiple
tablets; the workshop suggested this would not work and that it would be
better to think in terms of a daily fieldwork cycle and building a
synchronisation server which would sync all the tablets in the field
house at the end of the day, and that methodology has been
adopted.

Components of the system:
=========================

You are going to need the following:

Hardware
--------

**Android tablet(s)**

A decent size for field use, eg. 7\", with GPS and
camera.

**Synchronisation server**

A small portable server (eg. battery operated all-in-one wireless
server, possibly with solar recharger) or a laptop with a Wireless
Access Point. The server needs to run Ubuntu Linux. You can also use an
Internet server if the field house/lab is Internet connected, which
today is often the case except in remote
locations.

Software
--------

**FAIMS data collectionapp**


The free FAIMS app for Android has strong mapping capabilities and
internal/external sensor capture (GPS, camera, video, total station
etc.), feeding an SQLite database.


**FAIMS server application**





The free FAIMS server application for Ubuntu provides database creation
and wireless synchronisation of multiple Android tablets running the
FAIMS app.



Installing the software
-----------------------

Follow instructions at the following web sites:

FAIMS app      [Install Instructions.](../getting-started)

FAIMS server   (For now, you should probably use
demo.fedarch.org. Once you're comfortable with that, see the
instructions at the [server install guide](../Install+and+Run+the+FAIMS+Server))



Getting started
---------------
