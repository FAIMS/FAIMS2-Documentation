Loading Layers inside the Map View

Raster (basemap) layer
----------------------------------------------------------

The mobile application map screen supports the rendering of multiple
raster layers. It requires that at least 1 file is nominated as a
basemap.

You can load new and switch on and off multiple rasters by pushing the
layers icon

highlighted in blue. This signals that the layer has been selected. If
this is a Data Entry or a new Canvas layer you can edit it. You can see
the confirmation in the Map view as the name of the Selected Layer will
now appear next to the Layer Icon in the following
way: ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/j_HG74PPu4By3Woy9R3FGT84qrAnE4qH18_OCOLyWnJ4w856GrVyIarKuKSXmerD21Dr-VokdtiHXbsFd_IU_EIg3snxeTfWRC_vWLnXUNNjq6YE1YSnVJ81Og)[Database Layer]

additional bitmap images

files and load them for you

Load Database Layer loads the legacy vector files that have been
converted into Spatialite databases

map
