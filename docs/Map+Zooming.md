Zoom
---------------------

-   Zoom in by tapping the screen with two fingers and slowly spreading
    them apart. Notice the changing scale in the bottom frame.

-   When you zoom in and out, allow your raster time to adjust to the
    new scale. It may flicker on and off if you keep moving the screen
    constantly.
