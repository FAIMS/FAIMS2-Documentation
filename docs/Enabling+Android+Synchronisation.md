Sync with server {#EnablingAndroidSynchronisation-Syncwithserver}
----------------

 

[Every time you are within the local network produced by the FAIMS
server you can automatically synchronize all your data with
it.]{style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"}

 

Ensure that you have enabled the Wi-fi on your device and connected it
to the local network ( and not the internet network).

On the Map View, go to Communications Tab

Tap Start Synching button

Observe the color dot in the top right corner of the app.

-   If glowing red, it means that the app is having difficulty reaching
    the server.  If glowing yellow/orange, the app has found the server
    and synchronization is in progress. If glowing green, the
    synchronization is complete.

Allow for ample time for the synchronization to run in both directions.
