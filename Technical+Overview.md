The problem of {#TechnicalOverview-Theproblemof}
--------------

Archaeologists collecting field data on paper

Affects {#TechnicalOverview-Affects}
-------

Archaeology team members

The impact of which is {#TechnicalOverview-Theimpactofwhichis}
----------------------

 

-   Team members spend time in the evening digitising such data rather
    than using it

<!-- -->

-   Transcription mistakes can be made

 

-   Digital data from devices such as Total Stations or GPSs is separate
    to the manually collected data

A successful solution would {#TechnicalOverview-Asuccessfulsolutionwould}
---------------------------

 

-   Work for all Archaeologists, regardless of workflow or terminology

<!-- -->

-   Allow research data to be captured in digital form in the field

 

-   Free up time for the Archaeologists to do more valuable work

Components {#TechnicalOverview-Components}
==========

Web Application {#TechnicalOverview-WebApplication}
---------------

The web application serves as the central hub for data collection. A
user would create a project on the web app and then android users would
download the project onto their device and start collecting data in the
field.\
The android application has the ability to synchronise the data
collected in the field with the web app which in turn will be propagated
to other android users. This is meant to keep all users up to date with
their data in the field.\
The web application also allows administrators to cleanup the collected
data usually at the end of day.

Android Application {#TechnicalOverview-AndroidApplication}
-------------------

The android application serves as the collector of data. Users can
download a project from the web application and then start collecting
data in the field.
