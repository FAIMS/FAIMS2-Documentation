[Zoom]{style="color: rgb(102,102,102);"}

-   zoom in by tapping the screen with two fingers and slowly spreading
    them apart. Notice the changing scale in the bottom frame.

-   when you zoom in and out, allow your raster time to adjust to the
    new scale. It may flicker on and off if you keep moving the screen
    constantlyÂ
